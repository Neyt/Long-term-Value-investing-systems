# Long-term-Value-investing-systems

Have you ever read a book about investing, where they talk about the simplicity of using simple strategies to outperform the market. And wonder if they really work?  I'm creating a robust platform that would trade these systems for the next decades (even if they outlive me) and make this results public.  

## Systems like:
* SCREENERS OVERVIEW
* ALTMAN Z SCORE
* GRAHAM CHECKLIST
* GRAHAM FOMULA
* CASH ROIC
* FCF COW
* INSIDER BUYS
* LOW PE EXPECTATIONS
* MAGIC FOMULA
* NEGATIVE EV
* NCAV
* NNWC
* NNWC INCREASING
* PIOTROSKI BEST CRITERIA
* PIOTROSKI ORIGINAL
* SHARE BUY BACKS



These systems can be backtested, but backtesting is just theory. I want to replicate the real thing for generations to follow.
